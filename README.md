Drug plasma prediction Using GNN and CatBoost
The goal of this project is to create a hybrid predictive model for a regression challenge by combining a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with CatBoost. The main goal is to use gradient boosting techniques to increase prediction accuracy while utilizing graph-based learning to take advantage of the structural links present in the data. Both continuous and categorical features—one-hot encoded and standardized, respectively—are included in the dataset. The depiction of node interactions is made easier by creating a graph structure for every group in the data using a k-nearest neighbors method. An Enhanced GraphSAGE model, which has several convolutional layers and dropout regularization to avoid overfitting, is then trained using the graph as input.
The GNN-generated embeddings are used as input features for a CatBoost Regressor, a potent gradient boosting method, to further improve predictions. Key metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R2 score are computed over all folds in K-fold cross-validation, which is used to evaluate model performance. The model's efficacy can be seen through bar plots of the average metrics and learning curve visualizations. This method shows how classic machine learning techniques can be used with graph-based neural networks to increase predicting accuracy in difficult datasets.
